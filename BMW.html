            <p class="p4">Last week's Pill pairing of a brace of Rover 800s received a far warmer critical reception than</p>
            <p class="p5">office cynics expected them to. This week we're returning to more familiar ground with a Pill</p>
            <p class="p6">combining the carrot of 500hp, rear-wheel drive and a savage, rev-happy V10 engine with</p>
            <p class="p7">the stick of proven potential to deliver more bills than a William convention. Yep, it's an E60</p>
            <p class="p8">BMW M5 and, to the surprise of the database rodents, it is the first Pill has featured.</p>

            <p class="p9">We're about two minutes to midnight on the combustion engine clock, yet even with the end</p>
            <p class="p10">in sight it is surprising that no major engine cylinder configuration has yet become extinct.</p>
            <p class="p11">True, there are no straight eights any more, and some other oddball pre-war offerings have</p>
            <p class="p12">never been replaced. But the world still contains such compelling oddballs as the V10. But it</p>
            <p class="p13">won't for much longer: the Audi R8 and Lamborghini Huracan are both on the slide to retirement.</p>

            <p class="p14">Yet if only one V10-powered car was to be placed into a future Museum of Environmental</p>
            <p class="p15">Hatecrime you could make an excellent case for picking the E60 M5 in place of the more</p>
            <p class="p16">glamourous supercars; this really was about as mad as the early 21st century car industry</p>
            <p class="p17">got. In the noughties V10s seemed to be cropping up almost everywhere, with Audi using</p>
            <p class="p18">them for the more senior S and RS models and Volkswagen even jumping the shark with its</p>
            <p class="p19">V10 TDI. So it wasn't surprising that when BMW replaced the sublime V8-powered E39 M5 it</p>
            <p class="p20">did so with a new car featuring two more cylinders and a substantial power upgrade.</p>

            <p class="p21">But this couldn't come from forced induction. BMW's M Division wrote its own rules in those days, with</p>
            <p class="p22">the biggest ones pretty much carved in stone: no turbochargers, no automatic gearboxes, only rear-wheel</p>
            <p class="p23">drive. (Hindsight plays a sad trombone at this point.) The 5.0-litre V10 that was developed was a</p>
            <p class="p24">technical masterpiece, but it was also a deeply unlikely powerplant for a large saloon, making its peak</p>
            <p class="p25">torque at 6,100rpm and delivering maximum power just 500rpm shy of its 8,250rpm limiter. That's</p>
            <p class="p26">because, to the M Division of that era, driveability was less important than outright performance.</p>

            <p class="p27">To prove this point BMW laid on a runway on the original press launch, letting journalists</p>
            <p class="p28">perform a full launch control start and giving them strict instructions not to lift until the</p>
            <p class="p29">'brake here' boards at the far end. By the time these flashed pat the car was sitting on its</p>
            <p class="p30">limiter at an indicated 165mph and there was a distinct lack of tarmac remaining. Media</p>
            <p class="p31">events were different in those days.</p>

            <p class="p32">The E60's transmission choice was similarly performance focussed. The E39 M5's six-speed</p>
            <p class="p33">manual had been a bar to sales in those parts of the world too dumb to operate clutch</p>
            <p class="p34">pedals, and the E60 was shifted to an automated single clutch gearbox (a manual was later</p>
            <p class="p35">offered too, but never in the UK.) The SMT was certainly better than many of its rat trap</p>
            <p class="p36">rivals, offering varying degrees of shift severity, but even in the gentlest of these it was still</p>
            <p class="p37">abrupt and lurch-prone compared to a torque converter, or a more modern double-clutch</p>
            <p class="p38">transmission. Yes, you quickly get used to it. But when I drove BMW's own immaculately</p>
            <p class="p39">preserved E60 M5 a couple of years ago, the first I'd experienced since the car was on sale,</p>
            <p class="p40">it was the area in which it felt most dated.</p>
