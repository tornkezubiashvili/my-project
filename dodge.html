            <p class="p2">Challenger 2014 - 2023</p>
            <p class="p3">After introducing the third generation of the Challenger in 2008, Dodge constantly updated it for the next model years, but</p>
            <p class="p4">the first real facelift was for the 2015 model year.</p>

            <p class="p5">When Dodge made the third generation of the Challenger, it tried to re-create the first generation of this car, and it nailed it. It</p>
            <p class="p6">was big, with a dominating attitude, and powerful. Even the lowest-powered version still gave customers over 300 ponies</p>
            <p class="p7">under the hood. But the competition was fierce against the eternal competitors, the Ford Mustang and the Chevrolet Camaro.</p>
            <p class="p8">To keep its advantages, the 2015 Challenger came with several exterior, interior, and powertrain updates. Dodge unveiled it at</p>
            <p class="p9">the 2014 New York Auto Show.</p>

        <div>
            <p class="p10">The car had new headlights that sported halo-style LED daytime running lights. Besides the halogen bulbs, Dodge also offered</p>
            <p class="p11">the option of projector-beam (HID) for the outer headlamps for improved road illumination. Furthermore, to emphasize the</p>
            <p class="p12">mean aspect of the car, the automaker added black surroundings for these. Between them, the grille sported two horizontal</p>
            <p class="p13">rectangular trims, resembling the original Challenger from 1970. Depending on the version, the car sported hood vents and air</p>
            <p class="p14">intakes.</p>

        <div>
            <p class="p15">From its profile, the Challenger revealed a long hood followed by a short, raked windshield. Its short roof ended in a typical</p>
            <p class="p16">sedan-style rear window and a long deck in the back. The profile also revealed the coke-bottle styling for the rear fenders that</p>
            <p class="p17">resembled the muscle-car era of the â€˜60s. Dodge offered the Challenger in eight trim levels: SXT, SXT Plus, R/T, R/T Plus, R/T</p>
            <p class="p18">Shaker, R/T Plus Shaker, 6.4-liter Scat Pack, and 392 HEMI Scat Pack Shaker. Several other versions were added in the</p>
            <p class="p19">following model-year updates. Finally, at the back, the wide taillights flanked the Dodge lettering placed on the rear fascia,</p>
            <p class="p20">while below the bumper, the car sported side-mounted exhausts with different designs according to the engine version.</p>

            <p class="p21">Inside, the most significant upgrade was for the Uconnect infotainment system. The touchscreen display between the vents</p>
            <p class="p22">atop the center stack controlled more than just the navigation and the stereo. It also allowed access to various technical</p>
            <p class="p23">settings, such as those for the launch-control system. In front of the driver, Dodge installed a seven-inch TFT display placed</p>
            <p class="p24">between the large analog speedometer and tachometer. The center console housed two cup holders and the gear selector for</p>
            <p class="p25">the automatic transmission. Since the car was built for performance, the front bucket seats featured high bolstered areas. At</p>
            <p class="p26">the same time, in the back, the automaker installed a bench seat where two adults could sit comfortably. Last but not least,</p>
            <p class="p27">the trunk was large enough for long trips.</p>

        <div>
            <p class="p28">Under the hood, Dodge installed a choice of V6 and V8 engines ranging between 305 hp (309 PS) and 485 hp (491 PS) for</p>
            <p class="p29">regular models. In addition, the Challenger was available with the supercharged 707 hp (717 PS) 6.4-liter V8. Another</p>
            <p class="p30">significant improvement was for the transmission, where the 2015 Challenger received a new, eight-speed, ZF8HP gearbox that</p>
            <p class="p31">sent the power to the wheels.</p>
