     <div>
        <p class="p3">Mercedes-Benz introduced the refreshed version of the second generation CLS model in 2014, and along with the rest of the</p>
        <p class="p4">range, the most powerful version of it, the 63 AMG, has gone through an update as well.</p>

            <p class="p5">When the German automaker introduced the second generation of this four-door coupe on the market in 2009, it was an</p>
            <p class="p6">important step forward, although the car came during the world financial crisis, and that affected the brand's sales. Still, by</p>
            <p class="p7">2014, those numbers climbed back. Also, in 2014, the European Union started to switch from Euro 5 emission standards to</p>
            <p class="p8">Euro 6. As a result, not just Mercedes-Benz but all automakers had to upgrade their vehicles. The CLS 63 AMG couldn't make</p>
            <p class="p9">an exception, and the automaker used the moment to implement several other improvements to this four-door coupe.</p>

        <div>
            <p class="p10">The most striking change was noticed at the front, where the AMG received a diamond-pattern grille, which replaced the</p>
            <p class="p11">simple black one used on its predecessor. Mercedes-Benz also upgraded the headlights with the Multibeam LED technology</p>
            <p class="p12">and made them better for night driving situations. Furthermore, the automaker also changed the front bumper, which</p>
            <p class="p13">incorporated the A-shaped lower grille and the massive side scoops covered with a chicken-wire style mesh. From its profile,</p>
            <p class="p14">the 2014 Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG featured the same V8 biturbo chromed badges on the front fenders, behind the wheel</p>
            <p class="p15">arches. At the back, the automaker installed an upgraded bumper that featured a set of thin vertical vents on the outer</p>
            <p class="p16">corners, while underneath it, the CLS kept the same four rectangular exhausts as its predecessor. From its profile, the CLS 63</p>
            <p class="p17">AMG featured a set of 19” light-alloy wheels fitted with 255/35 tires up front and 285/30 tires to the rear axle.</p>

        <div>
            <p class="p18">Inside, the most significant change was for the infotainment unit. The automaker replaced the formerly used small color display</p>
            <p class="p19">neatly integrated into the dashboard with an 8” landscape-oriented screen mounted into a free-floating position. Even though</p>
            <p class="p20">it looked like an aftermarket piece of equipment, it was all original and was controlled by the same rotary dial housed on the</p>
            <p class="p21">center console behind the gear selector. Like its predecessor, the 2014 CLS63 AMG featured high-bolstered bucket seats for</p>
            <p class="p22">the front passengers and a bench profiled for two in the back, separated by a center console fitted with cup holders.</p>

        <div>
            <p class="p23">Under the hood, the automaker kept the same 5.5-liter V8 powerplant, helped by two turbochargers. In the AMG 63 clothing, it</p>
            <p class="p24">offered 550 HP, while the AMG 63 S 4Matic version added another 27 ponies to the pack. In addition, the latter version was</p>
            <p class="p25">offered with an all-wheel-drive system. Both versions sent their power via an AMG Speedshift MCT 7-speed automatic (multi-</p>
            <p class="p26">clutch) gearbox. For better handling, the automaker tuned the suspension and added a negative camber for the front axle.</p>
            <p class="p27">Moreover, Mercedes-Benz also enlarged the front axle's track by 24 millimeters (0.95”).</p>
