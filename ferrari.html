            <p class="p3">In 2019, Ferrari introduced the open-top version of the F8 Tributo and added the traditional Spider word after the F8</p>
            <p class="p4">nameplate. The car retained most of the characteristics of its closed-coupe sibling since it was developed in parallel with it.</p>

        <div>
           <p class="p5">Ferrari continued the story of the 458 and 488 with the F8 Tributo in 2019, followed by the open-top version of it in the same</p>
           <p class="p6">year. While some considered that it was more of a heavily facelifted version of the 488, it was more like a new car on older but</p>
           <p class="p7">upgraded underpinnings. The Italian automaker already had all the ingredients to create the Spider version when it introduced</p>
           <p class="p8">the Tributo at the Geneva Motor Show but made its customers wait a while since the closed-top model was the one that</p>
           <p class="p9">sparked the imagination of those who could race such a beautiful vehicle on a track, in friendly races.</p>
        </div>

    <center>
        <div>
            <p class="p10">The Italian automaker chose to pen the vehicle inside its styling center, which Flavio Manzoni led it. At the front, the LED</p>
            <p class="p11">headlights had a boomerang shape underlined by daytime running lights. On the lower side of the front fascia, Ferrari installed</p>
            <p class="p12">a broad splitter flanked by two small air inlets that grabbed the air and cooled the front rotors. An extracting vent placed on</p>
            <p class="p13">the front lid helped the F8 Spider to stick to the ground and created downforce for the prancing-horse supercar. From its</p>
            <p class="p14">profile, the open-top vehicle featured a similar windshield and sculptured door panels as its sibling. Ferrari opted for a</p>
            <p class="p15">retractable hard-top solution, and the roof could’ve been retracted in 14 seconds at a speed of up to 45 kph (28 MPH). Behind</p>
            <p class="p16">the cabin, Ferrari installed two bulges behind the seats that also covered the safety arches. There was no sloped rear</p>
            <p class="p17">windscreen. Last but not least, at the back, the F8 Spider featured a wing on the engine cover and quad exhausts underneath</p>
            <p class="p18">the rear bumper, poking through the massive diffuser.</p>

        <div>
            <p class="p19">Inside its cabin, the F8 Spider revealed a cabin for two occupants. The high-bolstered bucket seats were padded with expensive</p>
            <p class="p20">leather and were separated by the center console. Unlike many other cars on the market, this was not connected to the center</p>
            <p class="p21">stack to amplify the sensation of lightness. But light didn’t mean low-equipped, so the F8 Spider featured a 7” touchscreen</p>
            <p class="p22">placed in front of the passenger, who could assist the driver by selecting music. The one behind the wheel had to focus only on</p>
            <p class="p23">driving, fronting an instrument cluster where a large tachometer took center stage. It was flanked by two LCDs for the</p>
            <p class="p24">infotainment unit and the navigation system. In addition, these could also show information gathered from the car’s onboard</p>
            <p class="p25">computer.</p>

        <div>
            <p class="p26">The F8 Spider was lighter than the 488 Spider, and the Italian car manufacturer struggled to provide the best available solutions</p>
            <p class="p27">to lose pounds. In addition, it increased the performance of the 3.9-liter V8 twin-turbocharged powerplant by 50 PS (49 HP)</p>
            <p class="p28">compared to its predecessor.</p>
